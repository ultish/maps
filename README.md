This repo tests Leaflet, Openlayers, and maybe D3 for rendering geojson. How does it render these polygons when it crosses the antimeridian boundary (180degrees)? How does it render geojson when you scroll around the world? What if you're clipping half way across the antimeridian?

## D3

### No GeoJson parsing

D3 doesn't need any parsing :) 

Border overlaps when using geojson (thicker lines on neighbouring borders)

Convert to topojson, mesh, then back to geojson and it disappears. Mesh function removes overlapping lines

## Openlayer
### No GeoJson parsing

### GeoJson Antimeridian Cutting 
Cutting along antimeridian, leaves veritcal lines on 180degrees due to cutting

Scroll to right and polys duplicate correctly

#### custom geojson shifting instead of cutting

Red Cross isn't displayed, ol thinks its not within current extent?

## Leaflet
### No GeoJson parsing

### GeoJson Antimeridian Cutting 
Looks a bit odd due to lack of duplication, scrolling left or right into next world view will copy them but you only ever see 1 copy at a time

#### custom geojson shifting instead of cutting
everything fits on the one world view except for a bit of russia you see floating on top left corner

# Chart.js
Chart rendering using canvas instead of SVG for performance, and chart.js looks nice out of the box
